# Finn's Minecraft Maze Generator

Run

```bash
python make_maze.py
```

to generate a maze. Configuration and further instruction will appear in the shell.

The workflow of the code is:

- `make_maze.py` generates the maze and outputs it to `maze.txt` (will also output to `maze.zip` once I write that part of the code)
- The user places `maze.zip` into a world datapack folder, then the datapack's code is run when the world is opened
